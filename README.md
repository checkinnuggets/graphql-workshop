# graphql-workshop

This repo started life following along with the "Getting started with GraphQL on ASP.NET Core and Hot Chocolate" workshop which can be found at:
https://github.com/ChilliCream/graphql-workshop

The code has been upgraded to Hot Chocolate 13 and has had some updates, but it may not yet take advantage of the new functionality that HC13 offers.
